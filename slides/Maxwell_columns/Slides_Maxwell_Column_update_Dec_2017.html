# Update on the column study

## Literature: DRW have an impact on soil and bioreactor metabolism

--

- Drying-Rewetting (DRW) cycles in soils have a metabolic effect [@beare2009; @borken2009; @xiang2008; @ruser2006; @miller2005]

--

- Several orders of magnitude increase in `\(N_{2}O\)` production following rewetting of a dry low C soil (1.4-1.7%); due to denitrification [@ruser2006]

--

- DRW cycles increased C and N release by 18 and 10%, respectively, relative to soil cores (2.4% C content) 

--
 
- N release increased with the frequency of DRW cycles [@miller2005]

--

- DRW cycles reduce microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial ratios, while increasing the amount of microbial activity and dissolved inorganic N in soil leachates [@gordon2008]

--

- nitrate removal in woodchip columns increased from 48 to 90% following a single 96 hr DRW event [@christ2017]

---

## Identified gaps in the literature

--

- how DRW cycles affect C and N turnover rates in high C content media?

--

- long-term impact of regular DRW cycles on these turnover rates ?

---

## Research questions of the column study

--

- Is it possible to rejuvenate/enhance woodchip bioreactor nitrate removal capacities with DRW cycles? and by how much?

--

- Can we quantify the relative and absolute impact of the drivers of nitrate removal in woodchip bioreactors (T°C, HRT, DOC)?


---

## Method

--

- 50 cm x 15 cm diameter columns containing aged woodchips from a field bioreactor

--

- 8 columns exposed to prolonged saturation or weekly DRW cycles

--
    - 4 control (always saturated): SAT
    - 4 columns undergoing weekly 8-hour drained to equilibrium: DRW

--

- inlet water: stock tank containing nitrate-spiked tap water (~20 mg `\(NO_{3}\)`-N/L)

## Nitrate removal rates

- Nitrate removal rates calculated as:

`$$R_{NO_{3}} =  \frac{([NO_{3}]_{in}-[NO_{3}]_{out})*Q}{V}$$`
- where 
    - `Q` is the flow rate
    - `V` is the is the total woodchip-filled portion of the column based (0.009 m^3^) and not the total porosity
    - Overall unit is g/m3/d of bioreactor

---
## DOC production rates

- Nitrate removal rates calculated as:

`$$P_{DOC} =  \frac{([DOC]_{out}-[DCO]_{in})*Q}{V}$$`
- where 
    - `Q` is the flow rate
    - `V` is the is the total woodchip-filled portion of the column based (0.009 m^3^) and not the total porosity
    - Overall unit is g/m3/d of bioreactor

## Distinct biogeochemical periods

--

- Outlet conc. was considerably affected by time, column flow rate, and temperature, with the most variability during Days 0 - 100

--

- From Day 1 - 11 (Period 0), `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` were high with very little apparent removal
    - mean `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` for SAT and DRW columns were 17.6 and 17.4 mg/L

--

- After this initial period there was a rapid decrease in outlet `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)`, continuing to decrease through Days 30-34

--

- Days 20 - 50 (Periods 1 - 4): `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` = 6.3 and 5.7 mg/L for SAT and DRW columns

--

- `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` slowly increased through Days 50-70 (Periods 5-7)

--

- Sudden decreases in all columns occurred around Days 76 &amp; 96 ( `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` below 2.5 mg/L)

--

- Days 50-100: `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` 13.3 and 11.6 mg/L for SAT and DRW columns

--

- Days 147-171 (Periods 19-22): variability in outlet conc. greatly decreased; `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)` SAT and DRW columns during this time were 16.7 and 14.7 mg/L

---

## Nitrate removal rates

.center[
&lt;img src="Slides_Maxwell_Column_update_Dec_2017_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /&gt;
]

T°C variability from Days 0-100 was high, with less variability during Period 19-22. T°C differences between columns was low (mean difference &lt;0.4°C). Removal rates at Day&lt;1.2, during initial flushing of columns, is not shown.

---

## General nitrate removal rate fluctuations

--

- High variability in temperature and flow rates resulted in significant noise in `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)`

--

- Noise only moderately decreased when normalizing by flow

--

- The trends in removal rates are similar but counter-directional to the trends in `\([NO_{3_{out}}]\)`
    - supporting three distinct periods were occurring within the first 100 days. 
    - Removal initially low from Day 0-11, 
    - Increasing rapidly through Day 20, 
    - and subsequently decreasing Days 70-100. 
    
--

- During Days 20-50 mean removal rates were 21.4 and 23.1 `\(g N/m^3/d\)` for SAT and DRW 

--

- decreasing to 13.6 and 18.5 `\(g N/m^3/d\)` during Days 70-100. 

---

## Possible explanations for observations

--

- Low removal rates from Days 0-11 was most likely due to acclimation of the microbial community
    - Gungor-Demirci and Demirer (2004) saw microbial acclimation in an anaerobic digester took 3-5 days until gas production occurred 
    - Horiba et al. [-@horiba2005] found that steady-state conditions for denitrifiying bacteria in culture did not occur until 80 days after inocculation. 
    
--

While the woodchips were obtained from a field bioreactor, the water chemistry for the experiment was dramatically different from the sprayfield effluent leaving the tile drainage and may have required an adjustment by the microbial community. 

---

## DW cycles significantly enhance nitrate removal

--
 
- Differences in SAT and DRW column removal rates was determined using a two-sample t-test

--

- Besides periods 0 and 1, **Significant difference** between SAT and DRW

## DW cycles significantly enhance nitrate removal
### Removal rates in DRW ~20% to ~40% higher

--

- % difference between SAT and DRW grew over time

--

- In Periods 2-4, mean removal rates were 6-24% higher in DRW columns, relative to SAT

--

- In Periods 19-21, DRW removal rates were greater by 42-43%

--

- In Period 22 DRW removal rates were higher by 73-83% (however data was only collected during the first 3 days of Period 22 due to instrument error)

---

## Short-term patterns of enhanced nitrate removal

- Diff between DRW and SAT diminishes days 1-3, then stable day &gt;4 after rewetting
- Overall average rates values boosted by high rates just after rewetting

## Similar observations in the literature

--

- There are reports of increases in rates of carbon-fueled metabolic processes immediately after rewetting &lt;span style="font-size:12px"&gt; (Xiang et al., 2008; Ruser et al., 2005; Borken and Matzner, 2009)&lt;/span&gt;

--

- Aerobic breakdown of organics and release of cellular compounds during unsaturated periods could increase C availability, increasing respiration or denitrification rates

--

- This would help explain initial bursts of activity immediately after rewetting, but does not address why rates were still higher 7 days later

--

    - columns appeared to flush completely in &lt; 1 day
    
--

- Fully understanding what mechanisms are responsible for increased removal rates in DRW columns requries analysis of the carbon dynamics in the experiment

---

## Management considerations

--

- Do DRW benefits overweigh the intermittent lack of removal?

--

- Taking into account the intermittent no removal periods in the overall bioreactor removal capacity, it is possible to calculate the overall removal enhancement as a function of DRW frequency

## Nitrate removal as function of DOC production

### Period A: 

- `\(NO_{3}\)` removal decreased with increased DOC leaching

--

- `\([DOC]_{out}\)` were very low during this period as DOC in the initial column water was flushed

--

- `\([NO_{3}-N]_{out}\)` increases from Day 2-11 were mostly in reponse to changes in `\([NO_{3}-N]_{in}\)` and flow

--

- After this initial acclimation period, `\(NO_{3}\)` removal and DOC leaching rates were positively correlated for the rest of the experiment

---

## Nitrate removal as function of DOC production

### Period B:

- Highest DOC leaching and nitrate removal rates of all experiment

--

- No significant difference in how `\(NO_{3}\)` removal responds to DOC leaching rates (trend lines on top of each other)

--

- Lowest trend line slopes: microbes least effective at using DOC for `\(NO_{3}\)` removal
    
---

## Nitrate removal as function of DOC production

### Period B -&gt; D:

- DOC leaching and nitrate removal rates seem to decrease with time

--

- No significant difference in how `\(NO_{3}\)` removal responds to DOC leaching rates (trend lines on top of each other)

--

- Trend line slopes become steeper with time: microbes seem to become more and more efficient, as DOC production decreases, in DOC for `\(NO_{3}\)` removal
    
---

## DOC use efficiency ( `\(R_{NO_{3}}\)` / `\(P_{DOC}\)` )

`$$DOC_{eff} = \frac{R_{NO_{3}}}{P_{DOC}}$$`

--

- From Days 50-100 *(period C)*, `\(DOC_{eff}\)` are 10.5 and 10.5 for SAT and DRW groups, respectively

--

- `\(DOC_{eff}\)` 10.9 and 10.8 during Days 147-172 *(period D)*

--

    - differences are significant at the 0.05 level

---

## `\(DOC_{eff}\)` as a function of time

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;DOC leaching and NO3 removal rates plotted against days since rewetting. In both cases rates decreased quickly within several days of rewetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

## Nitrate removal as function of DOC production: Discussion

- Rate of DOC production: good predictor of Nitrate removal, regardless of treatment

--

- Small apparent difference between DRW and SAT in `\(DOC_{eff}\)`

--

- This suggests that the consequences of the DRW treatment are 

    - more production of DOC, 
    - Microbes with DRW seem to be able to produce more DOC even after 7 days
    - Small difference in `\(DOC_{eff}\)` suggests that DOC's nature produced under DRW and/or microbes ability to use DOC is not dramatically different than SAT 
    - Small but *__significant difference__* in `\(DOC_{eff}\)` suggests that microbes at play might correspond to different strains
    
--

- `\(P_{DOC}\)` may be the primary cause of differences between DRW and SAT groups

---

## Nature of DOC from spectrum indicators: `\(S_{r}\)` 

- Helms et al. (2008): nature &amp; molecular wight of DOC correlated with spectrum slope ratio `\(S_{r}\)` 

--

- `\(S_{r}\)`: calculated by comparing the slope of the absorbance spectrum from 275-290 nm to the slope at 350-400. 

--

- Could not find any clear and meaningful trend with `\(S_{r}\)`

---

## Nature of DOC from spectrum indicators: `\((S_{275-295})\)` 

- Slope between the slope for 275-295 nm `\((S_{275-295})\)` seems a bit more informative

--

- Helms et al. (2008) showed that the absolute value of the spectral slope decreased as molecular weight increased

--

- Before day 140, `\(S_{275-295}\)` became less and less negative

--

- This would indicate that the DOC leaving the column increased in MW over the experiment

--

- Neither `\(S_{r}\)` or `\(S_{275-295}\)` were well correlated with `\(R_{NO_{3}}\)` ( `\(R^2\)` &lt;0.001 and 0.08), `\(P_{DOC}\)` ( `\(R^2\)` &lt;0.001 and 0.12), or `\(DOC_{eff}\)` ( `\(R^2\)` &lt;0.001 and 0.08)

`\(S_{r}\)` values and `\(S_{275-295}\)` for each treatment group over the experiment. Slope ratios appeared to exhibit distinct behavior during each period discussed previously, and `\(S_{275-295}\)` increased (or became less negative in slope) over the experiment. It is unclear whether or not negative `\(S_{r}\)` or positive `\(S_{275-295}\)` values have a practical meaning.
